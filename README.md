# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A Python-based movie recommendation system that uses collaborative/content-based filtering to suggest relevant movies based on user preferences and movie metadata.

## 🔍 Features

- **User-based recommendations**: Suggests movies similar to a user’s highest-rated selection.
- **Flexible architecture**: Compatible with collaborative filtering, embeddings, or similarity matrices (`X`).
- **Builtin utility**: Includes sample implementations with scikit‑learn or custom similarity functions.
- Easy-to-extend: Add clustering, hybrid approaches, or deep learning models seamlessly.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.  
Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
1. Load Data
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
ratings = pd.read_csv('data/ratings.csv')
movies = pd.read_csv('data/movies.csv')
2. Train Similarity Matrix or Recommender Model
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
X = cosine_similarity(movie_feature_matrix)
3. Run Recommendations
python
Copy
Edit
from src.movie_recommendations import recommend_movies_for_user
recommend_movies_for_user(
    user_id=123,
    X=X,
    user_mapper=user_mapper,
    movie_mapper=movie_mapper,
    movie_inv_mapper=movie_inv_mapper,
    k=10
)

🧠 How It Works
Finds the user’s highest-rated movie

Locates similar movies using cosine similarity or another metric

Returns top-K recommendations (excluding duplicates or unseen items)

🛠️ Customization Tips
Change similarity method: Use Euclidean distance, Pearson, or tuned embeddings

Filtering: Exclude movies the user has rated already

Hybrid support: Mix collaborative filtering with content-based features

Batch mode: Generate recommendations for all users by looping or vectorizing
